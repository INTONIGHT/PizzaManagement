# PizzaManagement
An application for managing pizza within a restaurant
To run this application clone the code you will need to setup a connections.properties and I recommend hosting your own database for that ona  mysql server to get it to work fine.
After downloading ensure that you have maven installed then in your folder where its downloaded do a mvn clean install to install any needed packages.
Then run the main class. It will give you console outputs that allow you to navigate. There are a few bugs that I was unable to handle but it runs as intended for the most part.
